2. The grid represents your current Block Blast game state
3. Use the available blocks section to see your current pieces

### Setting Up Your Game State
1. **Manual Grid Setup**: Click individual cells to match your current game grid
2. **Random Fill**: Use "Random Fill" for testing different scenarios
3. **Clear Grid**: Start with an empty grid

### Getting Placement Suggestions
1. Generate or manually set your available blocks
2. Click "Get Best Move" to see optimal placements
3. Review suggestions ranked by score potential
4. Click on a suggestion to highlight it on the grid

3. The app will only allow valid placements
4. Lines will be automatically cleared and scored

## Strategy Algorithm

The helper uses a sophisticated scoring algorithm that considers:

### **Score Calculation**
- Base points: 10 points per block cell placed
- Line clearing bonus: 100 points × (lines cleared)²
- Multiple line bonus: Exponential scoring for clearing multiple lines

### **Placement Efficiency**
- **Adjacency Bonus**: Prefers placements near existing blocks
- **Center Positioning**: Favors central grid positions for flexibility
- **Gap Prevention**: Avoids creating isolated empty spaces
- **Line Setup**: Prioritizes moves that set up future line clears

### **Strategic Priorities**
1. **Multi-line Clears**: Highest priority for moves clearing 2+ lines
2. **Line Setup**: Positions that enable future line clears
3. **Center Control**: Maintaining flexible central space
4. **Efficiency**: Maximizing points per block placed

## Tips for High Scores

### 🏆 **Advanced Strategies**
1. **Plan All Three Blocks**: Consider the placement order of all available blocks
2. **Set Up Combos**: Position blocks to enable multiple line clears
3. **Maintain Center Space**: Keep the center accessible for larger blocks
4. **Think Vertically**: Don't forget about column clearing
5. **Avoid Islands**: Don't create spaces that can't be filled by available block shapes

### 🎯 **Using the Helper Effectively**
1. **Update Regularly**: Keep the grid state current with your actual game
2. **Consider All Suggestions**: Sometimes the 2nd or 3rd suggestion might set up better future moves
3. **Practice Patterns**: Learn to recognize high-value placements
4. **Use Efficiency Metric**: Aim for >50% efficiency (lines cleared per block placed)
